# Personal Recs

I joined a lot of different communities while I was looking for my first dev role, but these were my two favorite, and are places I'm still active:

- [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/join)
  > Virtual Coffee is a community that welcomes people at all stages of their tech journey. Our mission is to be a welcoming tech community that allows room for growth and mentorship at all levels, and to create meaningful opportunities for learning, leadership, and contribution for everyone.
- [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/)
  > The Collab Lab increases access to web development jobs for early-career developers and, in particular, people in under-represented groups in tech by providing experiential skills training in software team collaboration and career management.
