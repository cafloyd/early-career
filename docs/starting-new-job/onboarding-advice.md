Some common themes from the above resources:

- **Ask lots of questions now!** There is no better time to ask questions than when you are brand new and _expected_ to know nothing about how things are done at this company.
- **Contribute to onboarding documentation.** This is a great way to begin contributing to your team from day one. As the person to most recently go through onboarding, you are in the best position to know where there are gaps in the onboarding documentation.
- **Get to know your team.** Hopefully this is built into your onboarding process, but if not, schedule 1-on-1 calls with different people on your team so you can get to know them.

In addition to the above advice, two things I think are really helpful to do as soon as you start your job are:

1. **Update your resume & LinkedIn with your new job.** Once you've landed a job, your resume and LinkedIn are probably the furthest things from your mind, but I highly recommend updating them now while you still have the job description fresh on your mind (and possibly a copy of the job posting). I recommend checking both your resume and your LinkedIn a few times a year and updating as necessary - this way you can always rest assured that you have up-to-date documents. It's also much easier to remember what you've been doing over the past few months than it is to remember what you've been doing over the past few years.
2. **Start a brag doc if you don't already have one.** [This article](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) goes into more detail, but essentially this document will be crucial for helping you track your accomplishments for professional development, and as a bonus I find that having a document like this is really helpful for battling imposter syndrome!
