# üìù Tracking Your Work
In my opinion, effectively tracking your work and your progress is the first step in developing your career.


## Types of Records to Keep
- If you don't already have one, start a [brag doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) immediately. This is a place to keep track of your wins, which is really helpful for things like annual reviews, and is also a really helpful weapon against imposter syndrome.
- Another great record to start is a [developer journal](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/what-developer-journal), where you can keep track of things you've done and learned, and which you can use as a reference. (See also [daily work journal](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/09/coding-career-advice-daily-work-journal/))

My advice is to start tracking your work in the simplest possible way at first:
- Start with a tool that you are already comfortable with (For example, if you use Slack heavily, you can use a running DM with yourself. If you live in your IDE, you can create a repo of markdown files.).
- Start by just tracking the things you consider most essential to your job. I might recommend tracking your wins, and then notes on tickets you've worked on. As you build a habit of tracking your work, you'll think of additional things that are important to you, or ways of organizing the information that's more useful to you.

## Useful Tools
- My notetaking app of choice is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). (Here's an [intro to Obsidian](https://www.samjulien.com/get-started-with-obsidian-as-a-developer) if you'd like to learn more.)
- My task manager of choice is [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), which I've been using for the past decade.
