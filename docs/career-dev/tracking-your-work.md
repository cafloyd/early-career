# 📝 Tracking Your Work
In my opinion, effectively tracking your work and your progress is an essential first step in developing your career. Doing so regularly will make it much easier to make the case for a promotion or raise when it comes time for your annual review.

## Types of Records to Keep
- If you don't already have one, start a [brag doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) immediately. This is a place to keep track of your wins, which is really helpful for things like annual reviews, and is also a really helpful weapon against imposter syndrome.

  - Not necessarily a record to keep, but on the subject of celebrating your wins, I also really love this approach from Lara Hogan: [The importance of donuts](https://larahogan.me/donuts/)
- Another great record to start is a [developer journal](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/what-developer-journal), where you can keep track of things you've done and learned, and which you can use as a reference. (See also [daily work journal](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/09/coding-career-advice-daily-work-journal/))
- You can also track your work in a way that makes it [easier to spin up a resume](https://alistapart.com/article/the-career-management-document/) the next time you're on the job hunt.

My advice is to start tracking your work in the simplest possible way at first:
- Start with a tool that you are already comfortable with (For example, if you use Slack heavily, you can use a running DM with yourself. If you live in your IDE, you can create a repo of markdown files.).
- Start by just tracking the things you consider most essential to your job. I might recommend tracking your wins, and then notes on tickets you've worked on. As you build a habit of tracking your work, you'll think of additional things that are important to you, or ways of organizing the information that's more useful to you.
