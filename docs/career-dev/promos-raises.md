# ðŸªœ Promotions & Raises

## Promotions
An insight I heard that really helped me is that there are two common paradigms when it comes to promotions, and you need to get clarity about which is used at your company to understand how to advocate for a promotion. This is especially true if there is a less structured process for applying for a promotion at your company.

1. Promotions based on *potential*
2. Promotions based on *impact*

If your company promotes based on *potential*, this means you have to demonstrate how you are excelling at your current level and perhaps how you are already starting to meet some of the expectations of the next level up.

If your company promotes based on *impact*, unfortunately this means you have to demonstrate how you are already operating at the next level up and deserve to have that title.
