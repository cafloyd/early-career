# 🤝 Networking
:::info
A lot of people (myself included) are turned off by the word "networking" and the highly transactional connotation it carries. Instead, I try to think in terms of building and investing in my community, which to me also underscores the fact that it is a long-term investment that doesn't necessarily yield immediate results.

The common perception of a professional network may be as a means toward a new job, which it certainly can be, but to me the underrated benefit of a healthy network is that it can also be a support network. I've turned to my support network when I've been stumped on a technical problem; when I've wanted a second opinion on a work situation that seemed weird; when I wanted data to help me more effectively negotiate a salary; and yes, when I was job hunting.
