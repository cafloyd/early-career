# ❌ Layoffs

If you've been impacted by layoffs or suspect you might be soon, I hope the resources here are helpful to you. Please do your best to also make sure you're taking care of yourself.

## Checklists

- [Laid Off or Let Go Checklist](https://0sulml7kjpu.typeform.com/to/sf92yLdt) - This resource is from [Never Search Alone](https://www.neversearchalone.org/) which is a book and community that I've heard great things about and would consider looking into.
- [Layoff Guide](https://github.com/MapboxWorkersUnion/layoff-guide)
- [Layoff Runbook](https://github.com/derwiki/layoff-runbook)
- [Effective Immediately](https://github.com/derwiki/layoff-runbook)

## Job Hunting

- When you're ready to begin job hunting, you may find some of these [job hunting resources](../early-career/intro.md) useful. They're tailored to early-career developers, but a lot of the advice is relatively universal.
