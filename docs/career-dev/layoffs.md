# ❌ Layoffs

If you've been impacted by layoffs or suspect you might be soon, I hope the resources here are helpful to you. Please do your best to also make sure you're taking care of yourself.

## Checklists & Guides

- [Laid Off or Let Go Checklist](https://0sulml7kjpu.typeform.com/to/sf92yLdt)
  - This resource is from [Never Search Alone](https://www.neversearchalone.org/) which is a book and community that I've heard great things about. The book introduces a job search framework and the concept of Job Search Councils, which are small groups of job hunters that provide support and accountability to one another. I intend to look into joining a Job Search Council the next time I'm on the job hunt, and particularly if you're unexpectedly job hunting I think the moral support alone is a good reason to consider doing the same.

## Job Hunting

- When you're ready to begin job hunting, you may find some of these [job hunting resources](../early-career/intro.md) useful. They're tailored to early-career developers, but a lot of the advice is relatively universal.
