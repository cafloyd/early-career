# Tracking Job Applications

## Application Trackers

This is the [Notion-based application tracker I built for myself](https://www.notion.so/Job-Application-Tracker-Template-af1788d7fab74020a09299e3c2d58e2f) - you're welcome to use it if you like!

Here's [another Notion template](https://sarahpark.gumroad.com/l/JobHuntTemplate) from Sarah Park, [Huntr](https://huntr.co/) is another option, or even a Google spreadsheet - just find a system that works for you!

## Information to Track

This is the minimum I would recommend tracking for each job you've applied for:

- **The company and job title**
- **Current status** (prospect, applied, phone screen, etc.)
- **Link to the job listing** (I also like to copy the job description, because sometimes the job listing will come down while you're still interviewing, and it's really helpful to be able to reference the description)
- **Name and contact info** of anyone you've spoken to from the company
- **Where you heard about the job opening** (from a reference, from a Slack community, from a specific job board, etc.)
- **Dates of every step of the process** (when you applied, when you had a phone screen, when you interviewed, etc) - This will help you keep track of when to follow up if you haven't heard back from anyone
