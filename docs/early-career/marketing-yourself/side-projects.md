#  Side Projects
Side projects are an important artifact to include when applying for a job, particularly as an entry-level software engineer. Without previous professional experience to point to, side projects are a key means by which you can demonstrate your ability to do the job.

Here's my guidance for what to do and not to do when it comes to your side projects:

---

✅ **Do** work on projects that are relevant to your interests in some way. 

Focusing on something that is meaningful to you will make your project more personal and unique. Your enthusiasm will also make you more engaged and compelling when you talk about your project in interviews.
- Is there a problem you have that can be solved with some code?
    - Or alternatively, is there a problem you are aware of from a previous career that can be solved with some code? This can be a good way to market yourself for a coding job in that specific industry.
- Do you have a hobby outside of tech that you can incorporate into your project?

❌ **Do not** only include projects you created by following a tutorial. 

A key quality employers are looking for in a side project is your demonstrated ability to solve novel problems. Following a tutorial only shows your ability to follow instructions.

That being said, if you use a tutorial as a starting point and build off of it significantly, that can be a solid way of demonstrating your skills.
