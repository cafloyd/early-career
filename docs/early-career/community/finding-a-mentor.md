# Finding a Mentor



## How to Find a Mentor
- I was on the [Virtual Coffee Podcast](https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/caitlin-floyd) and talked about mentorship - both being a mentor and being a mentee.

- [How to Self-Mentor](https://www.samjulien.com/how-to-self-mentor)

## Structured Mentoring Programs
I don't personally have experience with these programs, but depending on your needs a structured program might be a good fit:
- [Leopard.fyi](https://leopard.fyi/) - Provides job search support, including mentorship, for women & non-binary folks in tech.
- [Merit](https://www.get-merit.com/)
- [ADPList](https://adplist.org/)
