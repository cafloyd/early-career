# How to Negotiate

## Negotiation scripts

For me, one of the hardest parts of negotiating was trying to figure out how to get the recruiter to give their range before I gave mine. If they beat you to the question, here are two responses I really like:

1. From [this video with Tori Dunlap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2eWCCG3pW4):

    > It's hard to understand the full scope of the role at this stage in the process, so I'd love to know your budget!

2. If you're from a historically marginalized group, I also really like this framework, courtesy of [Jennifer Riggins](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jkriggins_womenintech-activity-7130223925334085633-WF2c):

    > Well, `women in tech` historically get paid less, so I would ask instead what a `man` has been paid for this before.
