# Resume & Cover Letter

- I haven't personally used this resource, but if you're looking for your first dev job and want advice on setting up your resume, [this guide](https://thetechresume.com/complimentary-copy.html) looks really helpful!

- A lot of companies use Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) to filter through applicants - it's a good idea to try running your resume through an ATS like [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/) or [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/) to make sure it won't be auto rejected by these companies.
