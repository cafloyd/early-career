# Resume & Cover Letter

- I haven't personally used this resource, but if you're looking for your first dev job and want advice on setting up your resume, [this guide](https://thetechresume.com/complimentary-copy.html) looks really helpful!

- A lot of companies use Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) to filter through applicants - it's a good idea to try running your resume through an ATS like [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/) or [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/) to make sure it won't be auto rejected by these companies.

- If you don't know how to format a resume, [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/) has some useful templates

:::info
In the US, employers outside of academia generally expect a resume, not a CV. If you don't know the difference between these two terms, [here is a helpful write-up](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/difference-between-resume-and-cv).

Another thing to note - while it is common in some countries to include a head shot, when applying for jobs in the US, your resume should not include one. Due to concerns about discrimination, some employers won't even consider an applicant that has included a head shot with their resume/application.
