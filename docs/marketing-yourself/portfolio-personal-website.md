# Portfolio/Personal Website

A lot of early career devs ask "Do I need to have a portfolio/personal website?" There's no correct answer to this question, but if you want my two cents â€” if you're applying for back-end jobs, don't worry about having a portfolio unless you want to. If you're applying to front-end or full-stack jobs and think you'll enjoy the challenge, then it's a great way to showcase your skills. But if you're overwhelmed by the idea, spruce up your GitHub page and then focus your energy elsewhere.
