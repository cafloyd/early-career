# Self-Learning Resources

If you become a software engineer, you will have to do some self-learning at some point - it's pretty much a job requirement.

If you have the self-discipline to go this route from the start, there are definitely advantages - not the least of which is that self-learning is generally much more cost-effective than a bootcamp. Self-learning also has the advantage of being self-paced and much more customizable to your needs.

- [Self Taught Programmers: Advice, Challenges, and Why We Need Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j38_oXALe4U&feature=youtu.be) - this video features people who were able to become software engineers by teaching themselves. It might help you to get a sense of what to expect if you opt to go the self-learning route.

## General, Beginner-Friendly Resources

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog)
- [Frontend Masters Web Development Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/)
- [Scrimba beginner courses](https://scrimba.com/allcourses?level=1)
- [Web design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/) -Once you’ve learned some HTML and CSS fundamentals, I really love this interactive guide to basic web development!
- [Developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/)
- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) - Learning computer science fundamentals isn’t necessarily required to be a programmer, but it is extremely helpful context to have, and this CS course from Harvard is far and away the most recommended one

### Free Bootcamp Programs

Even though these programs are called bootcamps, I have them listed on the 'self-learning resources' page because there is more of an expectation of independent learning with these programs than with others, and I'd consider them to be some kind of hybrid between most bootcamps and self-learning.

- [FreeCodeCamp Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.classcentral.com/cohorts) - This is a free six-week fundamentals course that I think could be a really great way to learn some of the basics of coding to get a feel for it! If this link has expired, search for the "Free Web Development Bootcamp" from freeCodeCamp.
- [100 Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) - I know a few people who completed this program and have heard really great things about it! The 100 Devs community is also really strong and supportive
