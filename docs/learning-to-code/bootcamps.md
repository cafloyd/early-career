# Bootcamps

I attended a bootcamp, and it was definitely the right call for me. In my experience, there are two main benefits to attending a bootcamp over self-learning:

1. **Accountability**: I admire people with the will power to do self-learning, but that is not me. I needed the accountability of paying money, and having instructors and classmates expecting me to complete assignments or I absolutely would not have stuck with it.
2. **Network**: The network you gain by being an alum of your bootcamp can be extremely valuable. If a hiring manager recognizes your bootcamp, it could give you an advantage in the interview process. You might be able to leverage connections into a job referral, or at least get guidance from fellow alums. For this reason, I _highly_ encourage you to do your research about which bootcamps have the best reputation in your area, if you're going this route.

## Researching Bootcamps

If you're considering applying for a bootcamp, make sure to do your research first! An easy first step is to look at reviews somewhere like [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/).

Another tip to find programs with strong alumni networks is to look on Linkedin at companies you might be interested in working for, then check to see if any software engineers at those companies attended bootcamps, and if so which ones.

Obviously if you know any software engineers, especially ones that live near you, get their input here as well!

### Questions to Ask/Look Into

- How does payment work? Is it at all dependent upon you finding work **as a software engineer**?
- What is the percentage of graduates who find work as software engineers within a year of completing the program?
  For this question and the above, be mindful that some programs can use wording like "tech-related job" to cover anything from a software engineer to sales roles in the tech industry to social media management. If you have specific goals for the outcome of a bootcamp, try to be specific in looking for answers.
- What is the percentage of students who complete the program? This might give you insight into how supportive the program will be to you as a student.
