# Job Boards

There are a ton of job boards out there. Below are some that I liked. My advice would be to check out the options out there, and choose a few that you like to check regularly and incorporate them into your weekly routine.

- [Diversify Tech](https://www.diversifytech.co/)
- [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/jobs)
- [Protege.dev](https://protege.dev/)
- [No CS OK](https://nocsok.com/)
- [DC Tech Jobs](https://www.dctechpeople.com/dc-tech-jobs) (DC-based)
- [Built in NYC](https://www.builtinnyc.com/jobs/dev-engineering) (NYC-based)
- [4 Day Week](https://4dayweek.io/) (haven't actually used this one, but I like the concept!)

Job boards can be expensive, and not all companies post to them. If you have a dream company, it's a good idea to keep an eye on their "careers" page. It's also a great idea to join some local tech Slack communities - most have a job listings channel where people will post openings at their companies.
