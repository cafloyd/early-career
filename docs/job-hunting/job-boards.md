# Job Boards

There are a ton of job boards out there. Below are some that I liked. My advice would be to check out the options out there, and choose a few that you like to check regularly and incorporate them into your weekly routine.

## Other places to find job listings

Every style of technical interviewing has it flaws, but in my opinion whiteboard-style interviews are some of the worst (because they don't do an accurate job of gauging a candidate's ability to code). If you want to try to avoid them, here's a collection of companies [hiring without whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards).

:::tip
Job boards can be expensive, and not all companies post to them. If you have a dream company, it's a good idea to keep an eye on their "careers" page. It's also a great idea to join some local tech Slack communities - most have a job listings channel where people will post openings at their companies.

[This tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@tem.bv/video/7132616862885580075) also had a great tip for finding job listings - use [Google search operators](https://static.semrush.com/blog/uploads/files/39/12/39121580a18160d3587274faed6323e2.pdf) to your advantage. This is the search example used in the video, customize it for your needs:

```
site:lever.co | site: greenhouse.io | site:jobs.ashbyhq.com | site: app.dover.io (engineer | developer) "react" -staff -senior -sr. -principal -lead -"c++" after:2022-07-01
```
