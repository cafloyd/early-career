I wrote about [a small mindset shift](https://blog.caitlinfloyd.com/job-hunting-as-a-junior-developer) that helped both my mental health and my success rate when job interviewing. In a nutshell:

> View the job interview process primarily as a learning experience, and secondarily as an opportunity to get a job.

:::tip
Ask at least one question that shows you've done your **research** on the company. Start by looking into whether they have a technical blog, or whether there are any recent news stories or interviews with company leadership. These sources can help you identify **problems the company is trying to solve**, and asking more specific questions about those problems will demonstrate that you are thoughtful and informed.

:::caution
Be mindful of your **audience** when asking questions. For example, questions about compensation and benefits are best suited for a recruiter. In-depth questions about the tech stack are more appropriate for someone on the engineering team. Questions about company mission and vision are great ones to ask a CEO. Questions about company culture could be suited for any of the above.

If you're struggling to come up with questions to ask your interviewer, I really like this list that was shared by [Alejandro Ñáñez](https://github.com/alejandronanez), and it could be a great starting point for you to brainstorm questions that will be useful to you:

- Let’s say you walk into a bar with your friends, and then you start talking about the company, what would you say?
- How important is diversity for you, what are you doing to make it happen?
- How do you deliver feedback?
- How often you find yourself working outside of your 9-5?
- How often is engineering involved in decision making?
- If you had unlimited budget, what would you do?
- What would you like to change?
- You have GOOD engineers, and you have GREAT engineers. What set those two apart?
- A year from now, I’d like to say that I’ve `{a goal you have for the next year, for example "contributed to at least one of the backend/infra/mobile projects"}`. Do you think that’s feasible?
