:::tip
Ask at least one question that shows you've done your **research** on the company. Start by looking into whether they have a technical blog, or whether there are any recent news stories or interviews with company leadership. These sources can help you identify **problems the company is trying to solve**, and asking more specific questions about those problems will demonstrate that you are thoughtful and informed.

:::caution
Be mindful of your **audience** when asking questions. For example, questions about compensation and benefits are best suited for a recruiter. In-depth questions about the tech stack are more appropriate for someone on the engineering team. Questions about company mission and vision are great ones to ask a CEO. Questions about company culture could be suited for any of the above.
