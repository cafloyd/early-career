# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Job hunting is really tough, especially if you're looking for your first job as a developer, so I've put together some resources that were helpful to me in my job hunt. I hope they're useful to you!

Please note that my advice is all based on my experience as an American, job hunting in the United States. Some of this advice may be less relevant depending on your country or work status, so please keep that in mind when considering my advice.
